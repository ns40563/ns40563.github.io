	In Eloquent Rage, Cooper recounts different phases of her life as she evolved into a feminist. She learns how to disassociate with the "whiteness
	of mainstream feminism and implement her black girl magic, despite the constant reiteration from society that "...[black women]are irrational, crazy,
	out of touch, entitled, disruptive, and not team players." (Cooper, 2) Cooper does this by tackling issues dealing with racism from white society, 
	and even the Church's opinion on her sexuality. However, she was able to recognize that each of these groups are needed in an effort to create solidarity 
	and dissemble patriarchy.

	Eloquent Rage discusses how mainstream society and pop culture sexualizes and demeans Black women which is internalized in the black community.It is reflected 
	in relationships, the Black family structure, issues surrounding race and gender, as well as issues surrounding self-love. Yet, Cooper uses examples of black 
	feminist role models like Serena Williams, Michelle Obama, and Beyoncé to show how they have channeled their rage to be successful and influential, while surpassing 
	issues surrounding race and gender. . Not to mention, that her number one role model was her grandmother, who remarked that anger is not only legitimate; it is also 
	“a powerful source of energy serving progress and change.”

	In addition, Eloquent Rage discusses issues of racism and how patriarchy has been used to dismantle the structure of Black families. She makes point of how the continuous criminalization 
	of Black bodies throughout history and the present is based upon irrational fears and the need to maintain white supremacy through systemic oppression and desensitization.Cooper does this 
	by making reference to the accounts of Philando Castile, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin and others who have lost their lives at the hands of police and law enforcement, which sparked the 
	#Black Lives Matter movement.

	Lastly, Cooper brings mention to the need of the feminist movement to be more intersectional. In the chapter “White Girl Tears”, Cooper points out the need for white women to use their privilege 
	to help other women because “even as they rebel against the sexual strictures of white patriarchy…they have to realize that white men’s desires to regulate their sexual lives is predicated not 
	just on controlling white women’s bodies, but also criminalizing Black men and denigrating Black women.” (Cooper, 196) She supports this statement by mentioning the movement to defund Planned 
	Parenthood,which serves many poor women of color,the Black male rapist myth, and so on.

	Overall, Eloquent Rage is not only a Black feminist’s testimony, but a framework that suggests way in which feminism needs to evolve for the benefit of society as a whole. The book concludes with 
	a chapter labeled “Joy”.It provides a benediction that empowers her readers to take their personal lessons gained from the book and put them to use. She uses the benediction as a way to express the 
	need to use our rage as a way to break down systems that discredit, disable, and disregard marginalized groups, and build the kind of world we want to see, not just get rid of problems that exist.  
	She also expresses the ultimate need is to find joy, because within joy you are able to find internal clarity about your purpose.
